	<h3 id = "whatText">Blastcraft is a semi-vanilla Minecraft SMP.  We have a set of rules to prevent killing, griefing and trolling, but this doesn't mean light pranking isn't allowed. This allows our server members to all have fun, but not at the expense of others. We also have a friendly, welcoming community both on the Minecraft server and on the <a target = "blank" href ="https://discord.gg/zd3nuv6gM8" style ="color: blue;">BlastCraft Discord Server</a>, which you can join even if you aren't on the Minecraft server. Also, we have added a few datapacks from <a target = "blank" href ="https://vanillatweaks.net" style ="color: blue;">Vanilla Tweaks</a> that don't change the game too much and just slightly enhance the vanilla Minecraft experience.  Datapacks we have added include armor statues, fast leaf decay, and player head drops. You can find our full list of datapacks <a target = "blank" href ="https://www.craft.do/s/QfAKElkQWNxpf0" style ="color: blue;">here</a>. On the server, players do amazing things like building megabases, setting up shops for other players, and even make fun minigames! Join the BlastCraft SMP today for a semi-vanilla Minecraft SMP experience with friends!</h3>
